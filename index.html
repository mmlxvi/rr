				<p id="specialspecial">Welcome to Dr. Reed's Philosophical Counseling website. If you are looking
					 for philosophical, socratic counseling by telephone, we hope that you keep
					reading. Dr. Reed has been providing philosophical counseling for over
					fifteen years to many different types of people ranging in age from early teen
					years to senior citizens. No background in philosophy is required to benefit
					from philosophical counseling, nor is any particular level of educational
					 attainment. The only requirement is a desire to reflect upon and critically
					examine one's own life and belief system.
				</p>
					<p>
					Dr. Reed does not diagnose people as "mentally ill" and does not
					dispense medication. Rather, he focuses on "problems of living",
					including but not limited to issues surrounding religious and ethical
					 beliefs, questions of meaning, career choices and dilemmas, addictions,
					 relationships, depression, anxiety, and many other issues as well.
					 He draws from the 3,000+ year history of Western and Eastern philosophies,
					 as well as contemporary fiction and literature, socio-political criticism,
					 social sciences, art, music, and film to address client concerns.
				</p>
					<p>Philosophical counseling is not for everyone, for you as a
						client must participate in your own process of moving toward your
						full capacity as a human being - it is not some "cure" effected upon
						you, but a process in which you co-participate with the philosophical
						counselor in a journey towards your own progressive liberation.

							In <span class="bookTitle">Love and Death: an Existential Theory of Addiction</span>, Dr. Reed
							refers to an eclectic array of thinkers, in particular, existential philosophers Soren
							Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre. According to Dr. Reed,
							addiction is usually the result of existential or life conditions rather than
							 underlying physiological problems. Therefore, it may involve not
							 only drugs or alcohol but also relationships, belief systems,
							activities, and even emotional states. In this creative and provocative work, Reed
							argues that Sartre's theory of love is in fact a theory of addiction.
